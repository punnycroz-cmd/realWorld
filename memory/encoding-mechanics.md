# Encoding Mechanics — what makes a trace strong at birth (v12 focus)

**Track:** memory-research (sf/memory) · **Depends on:** `memory-model-spec.md`
§2 (the E formula and its existing modifiers), `formal-model.md` §5 (Event
schema), `individual-differences.md` (trait layer), `emotional-memory.md`
(arousal machinery — NOT re-derived here).

**Verdict tags:** CONSENSUS = textbook-replicated; ESTABLISHED = replicated,
magnitude noisy; DEBATED = contested or failed replications exist;
HYPOTHESIS = our modeling choice for RW, no direct literature claim.

## 0. What this version adds

Through v11, §2 priced an event by *what it was about* — arousal, self-
relevance, novelty, prediction error, who did it — and by *the state the
encoder was in* — sleep, stress, synchrony, age. What it did not price is
**how the event was processed**: depth of elaboration, the engagement mode
(observed vs enacted vs generated vs spoken), where the event sat in the
stream's segmentation structure (boundaries), and stochastic attention lapses.
The encoding literature says those are exactly the levers that decide whether
a trace forms at all — deeper than attention alone, and largely *invisible to
the encoder*. This version adds that layer: 14 new params, 5 new Event
fields, one deliberate frozen null, 11 probes (P106–P116).

Design constraint honored throughout: every term lands inside the existing
E formula or its §2 modifiers — no new record types, no new stores.

## 1. Levels of processing — depth is the master variable (CONSENSUS)

Craik & Lockhart (1972): memory is a by-product of processing depth, not of
effort or intent. Craik & Tulving (1975): semantic-orienting tasks roughly
double-to-triple recall over shallow (orthographic/phonemic) ones at matched
exposure; the effect is on *elaboration*, not time-on-task (Craik & Tulving's
own Experiment 8–10 — elaborate sentences beat congruent simple ones). Two
consequences the spec had been carrying implicitly and now makes explicit:

- **Maintenance rehearsal is a null.** Craik & Watkins (1973): rote
  repetition in mind ("rehearsing" a phone number you can't write down)
  improves *nothing* over a single exposure — only elaborative rehearsal
  helps. This is why `retell_boost` lives on the retrieval/reconsolidation
  side (§5.9) and why `rep_gain` (illusory truth, §6.3) moves *belief*, not
  strength: exposure without elaboration is not encoding.
- **Intention to learn is a null.** Postman (1964); Hyde & Jenkins (1973):
  once the orienting task is equated, telling subjects "remember this" adds
  nothing — the *task* is the encoding. Frozen constant `intent_null = 0`.
  RW consequence: a character cannot decide to remember; they can only be
  caused to process deeply. (Player-visible consequence: request-feed
  "make X remember Y" requests can only work by injecting a memorable
  *event*, never by flagging a trace.)

**Formalization.** New derived Event field `elaboration ∈ [0,1]` — the depth
of semantic work the event triggered. Default derivation (formal-model.md
§5 style):

```
elaboration = clamp(0.5·selfRelevance + 0.3·predictionError
                    + 0.2·coherence, 0, 1)
```

where `coherence` is how well the event fits the character's schemas/goals
(paradoxically, fitting material elaborates *more* — the reader has more to
think *with*: Bransford & Johnson 1972 comprehension-anchored encoding).
Encoding formula gains a term (spec §2):

```
E += elab_gain · elaboration          (elab_gain ≈ 0.25)
```

Depth is additive with the attention gate, not a replacement: a deeply
processed event still needs `attention ≥ att_min` (the gorilla is not
encoded no matter how interesting — Simons & Chabris 1999). Trait loading:
`open` and `consc` raise the effective elaboration of goal-relevant events
(individual-differences.md §3 row addition); `wmc` does NOT — WMC shows in
the `da_encode_mult` resistance below (§4).

## 2. Self-reference, quantified (CONSENSUS)

§2 already carries `w_self` on `selfRelevance`. Symons & Johnson (1997,
meta over 129 studies) pin its size: self-referent encoding beats semantic
encoding by d ≈ 0.65, but beats *other*-referent encoding by only ~half
that — the effect is elaboration+organization through the best-developed
schema a person owns, not a magic self-module. Implication for RW: the
`selfRelevance` drive should saturate — a 0.6-relevance event already
captures most of the SRE; the last 0.4 buys little. **Modeling choice
(HYPOTHESIS):** apply `w_self·selfRelevance` through a saturating transform
`selfRelevance_eff = selfRelevance^0.7` — concave, matching the meta's
compressed high end. Keeps the param, changes the curve; bands in P110.

## 3. Engagement mode — how the event entered (CONSENSUS, effect sizes in §9)

A scene's own participation structure is the biggest untapped encoding
variable for a life-sim. Literature ordering at matched attention:

**enacted > generated > spoken > heard/read ≈ imagined**

- **Enactment** (subject-performed tasks): performing an action vs reading/
  watching it — Roberts, Macleod & Fernandes (2022, Psych. Bull. meta, 145
  behavioral studies): g = 1.23 vs verbal encoding, ~0.9 vs watching
  another perform it. Critically for RW's age spread: patients — including
  memory-impaired and motor-impaired — retain the benefit; the advantage is
  preserved-to-enhanced in healthy aging (Engelkamp & Zimmer; meta patient
  section). Mechanism: planning + motor trace, not just "attention."
  → `enact_gain` on events with `engagement:"enacted"` (agent == self,
  physical action), applied *after* the age-scaled enc_base — enacted
  encoding sidesteps part of the decline curve (dementia-resilient motor
  encoding; Kessels, Boekhorst & Postma 2005 for the AD result).
- **Generation effect**: self-produced material beats read — Bertsch,
  Pesta, Wiscott & McDaniel (2007, meta: 445 effects / 86 studies /
  N=17,711): d = 0.40; *constrained* generation (forced specific output)
  is larger. In RW terms: dialogue the character composes, plans they
  form, conclusions they draw encode deeper than equivalent content they
  merely heard — even when they heard themselves say it.
  → `gen_gain` on `engagement:"generated"`/`"spoken-self"`.
- **Production effect**: saying aloud beats silent — MacLeod et al. (2010);
  Fawcett (2013) + Fawcett et al. (2023 updated meta): small-but-real
  between-subject recognition advantage, larger within-list against a
  silent backdrop (relative distinctiveness); reduces intrusions at recall.
  → `prod_gain`, small (0.08), strongest on recognition mode (§5.6).
- **Imagined** events already carry the §6.9 pipeline (`imagined` source,
  richness-gated flip). Imagined encoding is *weaker* than enacted but
  gains on rehearsal — no change this version.

## 4. Attention: the divided-attention asymmetry + lapses (CONSENSUS / DEBATED on lapse params)

Craik, Govoni, Naveh-Benjamin & Anderson (1996, JEP:G): dividing attention
at **encoding** produces large memory decrements with small secondary-task
costs; dividing it at **retrieval** produces small-to-nil memory decrements
with large secondary-task RT costs. Naveh-Benjamin, Craik, Gavrilescu &
Anderson (2000): the encoding hit is partly a *qualitative* shift to
shallower processing, not just less resource. Fernandes & Moscovitch
(2000): the retrieval side is not fully immune when the competing task is
verbal — material overlap matters.

**Formalization:**
- New Event field `daLoad ∈ [0,1]` (secondary-task pull at the moment of
  encoding: walking-and-talking, cooking while listening). At encoding,
  `attention ×= (1 − da_encode_mult·daLoad)` AND `elaboration ×= (1 −
  da_encode_mult·daLoad)` (da_encode_mult ≈ 0.5) — the hit is on *both*
  channels per Naveh-Benjamin 2000.
- Retrieval side: `cueContext.daLoad` raises `searchCost` and `ret_noise`
  contribution but does NOT move θ — retrieval is obligatory-but-slow, not
  fragile. (Contract note in §10; one frozen constant `da_ret_cost = 1.5`
  on searchCost.)
- **Enactment resists DA** (Engelkamp): enacted records take half the
  da_encode_mult damage — the motor channel encodes without central
  resources.

**Stochastic lapses.** Mind-wandering produces attention-collapse episodes
with the mind present-but-absent; encoding during a lapse is near-nil
(Smallwood & Schooler 2006; Maillet & Rajah 2013 — meta, mind-wandering
impairs subsequent memory; risk factors: poor sleep, stress, negative mood,
low task engagement). Model: per event, with probability `lapse_p`
(default 0.03), `attention ×= (1 − lapse_drop)` (lapse_drop ≈ 0.6) —
drawn BEFORE att_min gating, so some events simply never exist for that
character ("I was there but I have no idea what was said"). Trait-linked:
`lapse_p += 0.02·(neurot>0) + 0.03·(sleepFactor<0.8) + 0.02·(stress
state>0.6)` — loadings, not free params. This is the cheapest new
machinery in v12 and the most humanizing: it produces *unexplained* holes
in otherwise fine memories.

## 5. Event segmentation — boundaries, doorways, order loss (CONSENSUS core; magnitude DEBATED)

Event Segmentation Theory (Zacks, Speer, Swallow & Malea 2007; Kurby &
Zacks 2008): perception chunks continuous experience at points where
prediction spikes — boundaries. Consequences measured in narrative/film/
VR paradigms:

- **Boundary content is privileged.** Items at event boundaries are
  remembered better than mid-event items at matched exposure (Swallow,
  Zacks & Abrams 2009; Newtson & Engquist 1976 for the segmentation
  effect on subsequent structure).
- **Order degrades across boundaries.** Temporal-order memory within an
  event is good; across boundaries it is markedly worse even at matched
  delay (DuBrow & Davachi 2013; Ezzyat & Davachi 2011). Boundaries are
  where "which came first" starts failing — the wedge under
  `orderBefore`/`dateEstimate` (§6.15).
- **The doorway / location-updating effect.** Moving to a new room
  degrades access to information bound to the prior event model —
  including objects in hand and pending intentions (Radvansky & Copeland
  2006; Radvansky, Krawietz & Tamplin 2011 — real environments, not just
  VR; Lawrence & Peterson 2016 — imagined walks do it too; Pettijohn &
  Radvansky 2016 — the effect survives delay controls and is NOT rescued
  by returning to the original room, ruling out simple context
  reinstatement; Radvansky, Pettijohn & Kim 2015 — **no age difference**,
  event-level processing is age-invariant). Magnitude is small and
  load-dependent — a 2024 registered replication series found the effect
  reliable but smaller than canonical reports (mark DEBATED on size,
  CONSENSUS on direction + mechanism: event-model updating creates
  interference between adjacent models — the event-horizon account).

**Formalization** (the sim is spatial — this is cheap and high-yield):
- Event field `boundary:true` on segmentation points (task switches,
  arrivals/departures, topic breaks). Boundary records get
  `E += boundary_gain` (0.15).
- Event/context flag `locShift:true` on venue/room changes. On a locShift
  boundary: every record created within the last `0.02` day (~30 min)
  takes a one-time `R ×= (1 − doorway_drop)` (doorway_drop ≈ 0.15), and
  pending `Intention` records (§9) take the same hit — "walked into the
  kitchen and forgot why" is now an emergent sentence. Flat across age
  (Radvansky 2015).
- Order machinery: cross-boundary associative edges form at
  `link_p·(1 − boundary_order_loss)` (0.4) — same-event ordering survives,
  cross-boundary ordering enters the world already thin.

## 6. Distinctiveness — isolation, not weirdness (CONSENSUS on isolation; DEBATED on bizarreness)

- **Von Restorff / isolation**: an item that is categorically different
  from its local context is remembered better (Hunt 1995; Schmidt 1991 —
  primary vs secondary distinctiveness; the effect needs the item to be a
  *statistical* outlier in the encoded stream, not merely unusual in the
  world). → Event field `isolated:true` when the world/event bus marks the
  event an outlier within its episode type; `E += distinct_gain` (0.15).
- **Bizarreness** (weird images/mnemonics): meta-analytic verdict is weak —
  the advantage appears mainly in within-list designs and largely reduces
  to isolation (McDaniel & Einstein; Worthen & colleagues). DEBATED → no
  dedicated param; bizarreness feeds `novelty`/`isolated` only.
- Deliberate design note: `distinct_gain` is context-relative, not
  trait-relative — a character in a routine life gets MORE isolations per
  month, not fewer (their stream has less variance), which compounds the
  routine-heavy modifier's blur: their rare odd day stands out against
  mush. HYPOTHESIS for RW pacing: this is what lets one strange Tuesday
  survive a decade of commutes.

## 7. Unitization rescues the associative deficit (ESTABLISHED)

The aging literature's most actionable encoding finding for our `link_p`
machinery (v0.3, Naveh-Benjamin 2000): when to-be-bound elements can be
encoded as a **single coherent unit**, older adults' associative memory
rebounds toward young-adult levels — Giovanello & Schacter (2012);
Bastin et al. (2013); Ahmad, Fernandes & Hockley (2015). Unitization
effectively converts an association into an item, bypassing the deficit.

**Formalization:** Event field `coherentUnit:true` (person doing their
signature action; object in its canonical place; name on a familiar face).
At encoding, `link_p_eff = link_p + unitize_gain·(1 − link_p)`
(unitize_gain ≈ 0.3). Because `link_p` is lowest exactly in the cohort
that needs it, the term is automatically age-targeted — the older adult
remembers "Sanna opened the shop" whole while "who was at the meeting"
fragments. P114 tests the interaction.

## 8. Encoding-side mood congruence (ESTABLISHED, small)

v0.2's `encodeMood` field is used only at retrieval (state dependence,
§5.3). The encoding side is a separate, older finding: mood at intake
biases *which* content elaborates — mood-congruent material gets processed
deeper and encoded better (Bower 1981; meta Ucros 1989 — reliable but
modest, asymmetric toward positive moods). Small additive term:
`E += mood_cong_encode·|encodeMood|` when sign(valence) == sign(encodeMood)
(mood_cong_encode ≈ 0.1). Keep it small: the Ucros meta's own moderator
analysis shows the effect shrinks when selfRelevance is already high —
clamp the term to `×(1 − selfRelevance)` so it only moves thin, ambient
content. SHOULD-tier.

## 9. Survival processing — adjudicated, folded, no new param (DEBATED → resolved)

Nairne's adaptive-memory effect (Nairne, Pandeirada & Thompson 2008):
rating items for survival value beats even self-reference and generation.
Scofield, Buchanan & Kostic (2018) meta with bias correction:
η²p ≈ .06–.09 between-subject, .15–.18 within — real, medium, smaller
than the canonical claims. Mechanism analyses (Klein 2012; Kroneisen &
Erdfelder; Burns et al.) converge on elaboration + planning + self-
relevance — i.e., survival processing is not a sixth memory system, it is
an *elaboration delivery device*. **Verdict: no dedicated param.** The
Event field `survivalRelevance` (0..1, optional from the world layer —
physical-threat relevance of the event) feeds `elaboration` directly
(`elaboration += 0.3·survivalRelevance` before clamping). P115 tests
absorption: after the fold, a dedicated survival term must add ≤0.02 E —
if it adds more, the fold is wrong and the param gets reinstated.

## 10. What we deliberately did NOT add

- **Testing effect at encoding** — retrieval practice > restudy (Roediger
  & Karpicke 2006; Rowland 2014 meta g≈0.5) is already inside the model
  as §4.11's `s_gain` on difficult retrieval: a recall IS the practice.
  Cross-reference only; no double-counting.
- **Subsequent-memory neuroimaging** (Paller & Wagner 2002 — hippocampal/
  prefrontal dm effects): mechanism support for the attention/elaboration/
  predictionError terms already priced; not simulatable at our grain.
- **Emotional encoding** — entire channel delivered in v0.5 (ABC, blink,
  selective consolidation); untouched here.
- **Picture superiority / dual coding** (Paivio): partially present via
  `vivid_detail` field-width. Added `concrete_gain` (0.1) on sensory-rich
  events — concrete/imageable content encodes deeper; this is the term
  that makes *places and faces* outlast *arguments* in the archive.

## 11. Parameter summary (new in v1.2 spec table)

| param | default | range (clamp) | mechanism | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `elab_gain` | 0.25 | 0–0.5 | deep/elaborative processing term | Craik & Tulving 1975; CONSENSUS |

| `mood_cong_encode` | 0.1 | 0–0.3 | mood-congruent elaboration bonus | Bower 1981; Ucros 1989 |

**Frozen constants (v1.2):** `intent_null = 0` (intention-to-learn adds
nothing past orienting task — Postman 1964; Hyde & Jenkins 1973; a frozen
zero IS the finding), `da_ret_cost = 1.5` (retrieval-DA searchCost
multiplier), `lapse_window = 0.02` day (doorway reach, ~30 min),
`elaboration` weights {0.5, 0.3, 0.2} (LoP derivation mix — hypothesis,
audited by P110).

## 12. Validation probes P106–P116

Tiered per validation-design.md §2.1 (MUST = consensus machinery; SHOULD =
established-noisy; OBSERVE = debated). Bands use the §3 protocol
(replication-discounted where single-literature).

- **P106 (MUST) generation:** matched-attention events where the character
  composed the line vs heard it → generated records recall higher,
  T-diff band d ∈ [0.25, 0.6] (Bertsch discount).
- **P107 (MUST) enactment & aging:** enacted vs observed advantage present
  in all bands and NOT smaller in the 65+ cohort — TOST on the
  interaction (patient-preserved finding).
- **P108 (SHOULD) doorway:** locShift event → accessibility dip on
  records < lapse_window old + pending intentions; flat across age
  (Radvansky 2015); magnitude band admits DEBATED status (wide).
- **P109 (MUST) boundary structure:** boundary records > mid-event at
  matched arousal/attention; `orderBefore` accuracy drops across
  boundaries vs within at matched Δt.
- **P110 (MUST) elaboration:** shallow vs deep matched-attention events →
  ≥1.5× recall at 7 days; rote-repetition control (same event re-encoded
  with elaboration held at floor) adds ≤0.05 — the maintenance-rehearsal
  null tested *inside* the model.
- **P111 (MUST) intention null:** `intent` flag on/off at fixed
  elaboration → TOST equivalence. If intent moves E, the frozen constant
  is broken by construction — this probe guards the invariant.
- **P112 (MUST) DA asymmetry:** daLoad=0.7 at encoding costs ≥3× the
  recall loss of daLoad=0.7 at retrieval; retrieval-side cost shows in
  searchCost, not hit rate.
- **P113 (SHOULD) production:** spoken > observed in recognition mode;
  recall-mode advantage smaller or nil (Fawcett 2023 asymmetry).
- **P114 (SHOULD) unitization:** age × coherentUnit interaction on link
  formation — older cohort's link deficit shrinks ≥40% on unit events.
- **P115 (OBSERVE) survival absorption:** after the elaboration fold, a
  residual survival term contributes ≤0.02 E (equivalence). Guards the
  no-param decision.
- **P116 (SHOULD) lapse structure:** lapse_p produces a bimodal
  low-attention tail in the E distribution; lapse incidence correlates
  with sleep/neurot loadings per §4 (r ∈ [0.2, 0.6]).

## 13. Spec deltas delivered

- `memory-model-spec.md` → v1.2: §2 +7 mechanism bullets (elaboration,
  saturating selfRelevance, engagement modes, DA asymmetry, lapses,
  segmentation/boundary/doorway, unitization, mood-congruence,
  concreteness); §7 +14 params + 4 frozen constants; §10 contract +
  Event fields (`engagement`, `daLoad`, `boundary`, `locShift`,
  `coherentUnit`, `isolated`, `survivalRelevance`) and daLoad on
  cueContext. All optional w/ defaults; backward compatible.
- `character-memory-profiles.md`: §0 +14 clamp rows; archetype deltas
  (older adult `unitize_gain`↑, `lapse_p`↑; child `enact_gain`↑ — motor
  encoding is the intact channel; depressive/poor-sleep modifiers gain
  `lapse_p` deltas); v1.2 note.
- `validation-design.md`: registry extended to P106–P116.
- `human-memory-research.md`: §17 v12 summary appended.
